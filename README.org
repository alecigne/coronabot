#+TITLE: Covid-19 Mail Sender

This Spring Boot application retrieves statistics about Covid-19 at
the end of each day, and sends them by email the next day at 6am. It
also offers a REST API that is meant to be consumed by an Angular
webapp (under development).

It runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 on my local network.
