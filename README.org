#+TITLE: Covid-19 Mail Sender

This simple Spring Boot application sends Covid-19 statistics by
email, every day at 6 am. It runs on a Raspberry Pi on my local
network.

* Build steps

This process will be improved by using the ~gulp~ Gradle plugin.

1. ~npm run build~
2. ~gulp build~
3. ~./gradlew clean build~

* TODOs and MAYBEs

- [X] Better error handling (API call and sending email)
- [ ] Store recipients in a database and add them through a Web
  interface
- [ ] Manage secret information (source email login and password,
  recipients)
- [ ] Create an Angular web interface
