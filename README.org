#+TITLE: Covid-19 Mail Sender

This simple Spring Boot application runs on a Raspberry Pi on my local
network. It sends Covid-19 statistics for France by email, every day
at 6 am.

* TODOs and MAYBEs

- [ ] Better error handling (API call and sending email)
- [ ] Store recipients in a database and add them through a Web
  interface
- [ ] Manage secret information (source email login and password,
  recipients)
